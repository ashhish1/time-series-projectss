Project 289. Seasonality decomposition
Description:
Seasonality decomposition separates a time series into three components:

Trend: Long-term progression

Seasonality: Repeating short-term cycle

Residual: Noise or irregularities

This helps in understanding underlying patterns and preparing data for forecasting. We'll use seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) from statsmodels.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Seasonal Decomposition with STL):
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import STL
 
# Load monthly stock data (resampled): Apple
df = yf.download("AAPL", start="2018-01-01", end="2023-01-01")
monthly = df["Close"].resample('M').mean()
 
# Apply STL decomposition
stl = STL(monthly, seasonal=13)
result = stl.fit()
 
# Plot components
result.plot()
plt.suptitle("STL Decomposition â€“ Apple Monthly Stock Price", fontsize=14)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
âœ… What It Does:
Resamples daily data to monthly averages for smoother seasonal patterns

Applies STL decomposition to extract:

Trend component

Seasonal component

Residual/noise component

Visualizes each to reveal hidden dynamics
